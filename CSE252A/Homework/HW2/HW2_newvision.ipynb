    "### Lambertian Illumination\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest models available to render 3D objections with illumination is the Lambertian model. This\n",
    "model finds the apparent brightness to an observer using the direction of the light source $\\mathbf{L}$ and the normal\n",
    "vector on the surface of the object $\\mathbf{N}$. The brightness intensity at a given point on an object’s surface, $\\mathbf{I_d}$, with\n",
    "a single light source is found using the following relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{I_d} = \\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{N} (I_l\\mathbf{C})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $\\mathbf{C}$ and $I_l$ are the the color and intensity of the light source respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phong Illumination\n",
    "\n",
    "One major drawback of Lambertian illumination is that it only considers the diffuse light in its calculation of\n",
    "brightness intensity. One other major component to illumination rendering is the specular component. The\n",
    "specular reflectance is the component of light that is reflected in a single direction, as opposed to all directions,\n",
    "which is the case in diffuse reflectance. One of the most used models to compute surface brightness with specular\n",
    "components is the Phong illumination model. This model combines ambient lighting, diffused reflectance as well\n",
    "as specular reflectance to find the brightness on a surface. Phong shading also considers the material in the scene\n",
    "which is characterized by four values: the ambient reflection constant ($k_a$), the diffuse reflection constant ($k_d$),\n",
    "the specular reflection constant ($k_s$) and $\\alpha$ the Phong constant, which is the ‘shininess’ of an object. Furthermore,\n",
    "since the specular component produces ‘rays’, only some of which would be observed by a single observer, the\n",
    "observer’s viewing direction ($\\mathbf{V}$) must also be known. For some scene with known material parameters with $M$\n",
    "light sources the light intensity $\\mathbf{I}_{phong}$ on a surface with normal vector $\\mathbf{N}$ seen from viewing direction $\\mathbf{V}$ can be\n",
    "computed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{I}_{phong} = k_{a}\\mathbf{I}_{a} + \\sum_{m\\in M}\\left\\{k_d(\\mathbf{L}_{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{N})\\mathbf{I}_{m,d} + k_{s}(\\mathbf{R}_{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{V})^{\\alpha}\\mathbf{I}_{m,s}\\right\\}\\text{,}$$\n",

    "$$\\mathbf{R}_{m} = 2\\mathbf{N}(\\mathbf{L}_{m}\\cdot\\mathbf{N}) - \\mathbf{L}_{m}\\text{,}$$\n",

    "1. Write the function `lambertian()` that calculates the Lambertian light intensity given the light direction $\\mathbf{L}$ with color and intensity $\\mathbf{C}$ and $I_l = 1$, and normal vector $\\mathbf{N}$. Then use this function in a program that calculates and displays the specular sphere and the pear using each of the two lighting sources found in Table 1. *Note: You do not need to worry about material coefficients in this model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the function `phong()` that calculates the Phong light intensity given the material constants $(k_a, k_d, k_s, \\alpha)$, $\\mathbf{V} = (0, 0, 1)^\\top$, $\\mathbf{N}$ and some number of $M$ light sources. Then use this function in a program that calculates and displays the specular sphere and the pear using each of the sets of coefficients found in Table 2 with each light source individually, and both light sources combined.\n",
